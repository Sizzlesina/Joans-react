* Peformance optimization tools:
@ 1- Prevent wasted renders:
ðŸ‘‰ memo
ðŸ‘‰ useMemo
ðŸ‘‰ useCallback
ðŸ‘‰ passing elements as children or regular prop
@ 2- Improve app speed/ responsiveness: 
ðŸ‘‰ useMemo
ðŸ‘‰ useCallback
ðŸ‘‰ useTransition
@ 3- Reduce bundle size:
ðŸ‘‰ Using fewer 3rd-party packages 
ðŸ‘‰ Code splitting and lazy loading

++ Quote: This list of tools and techniques is, by no means, exhaustive. You're already doing many optimizations by following the best practices i have been showing you. -Jonas

* When does a components instance re-render?
@ A component isntance only get re-render in 3 different situations:
1 - State changes
2 - Context changes
3 - Parent re-renders => Creates the false impression that changing the props re-renders a component. This is not true

! Question: when the props changes will the component get re-renders? 
* Answer : NO     

++ Remember: a render does not mean that the DOM actually gets updated, it just means the component function gets called. But this can be an expensive operation.


* Wasted render: a render that didn't produce any change in the DOM 
!- usually the wasted render is not a problem for react because react is very fast
++ - Only a problem when they happen too frequently or when the component is very slow    



- When we have a component inside an another component and we dont the inside component to be re-rendered we can simply just pass in the component as a children prop to the other component and put it in the component as a child


* Underestanding memo:
@ What is memoization?
- Optimization technique that executes a pure function once and saves the result in memory. If we try to execute the function again with the same arguments as before, the previously saved result will be returned , without executing the function again

ðŸ‘‰ Memoize components with memo
ðŸ‘‰ Memoize objects with useMemo
ðŸ‘‰ Memoize functions with useCallback
 
@ It will:
1 - Prevent wasted renders
2 - Improve app speed/responsiveness

* The memo function:
@ - Used to create a component that will not re-render when its parent re-renders, as long as the props stay the same between renders - Memoized component

@ - Only affect props! A memoized component will still re-render when its own state changes or when a context that it's subscibed to changes

@ - Only makes sense when the component is heavy (slow rendering) re-renders often, and does so with the same props
