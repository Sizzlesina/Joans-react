* What is TAILWIND CSS?:
👉 - A utility first CSS framework packed with utility classed like "flex, text-center" and "rotate-90" that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup (HTML or JSX)

@ 👉 - Utility first CSS approach: writing tiny classes with one single purpose and then combining them to build entire layouts

👉 - In tailwind, these classes are already written for us. So we're not gonna write any new CSS, but instead use some of tailwind's hundreds of classes


* The good and bad about tailwind:
@ The good:
1 - You dont need to think about class names
2 - No jumping between files to write markup and styles
3 - Immediately undrestand styling in any project that uses tailwind
4 - Tailwind is a design system: many design decisions have been taken for you,which makes UI's look better and more consistent
5 - Saves a lot of time, e.g. on responsive design
6 - Docs and VS code integration are great

@ The bad:
1 - Markup (HTML or JSX) looks very unreadable, with lots of class names (you get used to it)
2 - You have to learn a lot of class names (but after a day of usage you know fundementals)
3 - You need to install and set up tailwind on each new project
4 - You're giving up on "vanilla CSS" 🥲

++ Many people love to hate on tailwind for no reason. Please don't be that person! Try it before judging 🙏
