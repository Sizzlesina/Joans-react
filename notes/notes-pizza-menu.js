before the react version 18 they were render the root like this :

 React.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root")

JSX is combined the CSS , HTML and JavaScript codes all together


we can use the arrow functions in react like this:
const test = () => {}


in react we must keep a simple rule for all the functions:

1. the function must start with a capital letter
2. the function must return a markup


Components in react contains the Data, Logic and Appearance all together 


lets talk about the Declartive and Imperative type of codes:

Imperative :
  1. Manual DOM element selection and DOM traversing
  2. Step by step DOM manipulation until we reach the desired UI
  HINT: it's about how to do things

Declarative;
  1. Describe what UI should look like using JSX based on current data 
  2. React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
  3. Instead we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data
  HINT: its about what we want


we can style our html code in React like this (But in real-world apps maybe we dont do this):

function App() {
  const style = { color: "red", fontSize: "48px", textTransfor: "uppercase" };

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      <h1>Sina</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
}



in React we dont use 'class' for the naming the classes of a element instead we use "className"

when we want to pass in a jacvascript code like a number in the props you must use the javascript codes and it works with "{}" 





* NOW we want to talk about props;
  1. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component use)
  2. Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
  3. with props, parent components control how child componets look and work
  4. Anything can be passed as props : single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components
  5. Props are read-only, they are immutable! this is one of React's strict rules 
  6. If you need to mutate props,you actually need state BECASUE:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
   @ 1. mutating props whould effect parent. creating side effects (not pure)
   @ 2. Components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state
   @ 3. This allows React to optimize apps, avoid bugs, make app predictable
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

   ++ in React data only can be passed from parent to child element
    


* General rules of JSX:
  1. JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter "JavaScript mode" by using {} (for text or attributes)
  2. We can place javascript expressions inside {}. Examples: refrence variables, create arrays or objects, [].map(),ternary operator
  3. Statements are not allowed (if/else, for/switch)
  4. JSX produces a javascript expression:
   ++ 1. We can place other pieces of JSX inside {}
   ++ 2. We can write JSX anywhere inside a component (if/else, assign to variables, pass it into function)
  
  5. A piece of JSX can only have one root element if you need more,use <React.Fragment> {or the short <>}


* Diffrence between JSX and HTML :
1. className instead of HTML's classes
2. htmlFor instead of HTML's for
3. Every tag needs to be closed, Examples: <img /> or <br />
4. All event handlers and other properties need to be camelCased Examples: onClick or onMouseOver
5. Exception: aria-* and data-* are written with dashes like in the HTML
6. CSS inline styles are written like this: {{style}} (to refrence a variable and then an object)
7. CSS property names are also camelCased
8. Comments need to be in {} (because they are JS)



@ when we use the && operator we want to if the first value was true the app return us the second value and if the value of the first parameter was fasle then it returns nothing (because React wont return "true" or "false" and it will always returns a value)
! HINT: Now we have to choose if we want to use the ternary operator or tbe && operator based on our app









TIP: in my opinion the best way to use the conditional rendering is to use the ternary operator 



WARNING: Outside of the JSX we can write if/else statement but inside the JSX it must only returns value so we cant use if/else statement 




Pizza Menu Project piece of codes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {pizzaObj.soldOut ? (
          <span>SOLD OUT</span>
        ) : (
          <span>{pizzaObj.price}</span>
        )} 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
if we want to check if a condition is true return the null value (for example when we dont want to show a element if a certain condition is not true) we can use the if/else statement outside the JSX like this piece of code from the pizza-menu project:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
we were write diffrent conditional rendering piece of code but all of them has the same output so now lets take a look at them:

const isOpen = 12;
{isOpen && "We're currently open"}
{isOpen ? "We're currently open" : null}

if(pizzaObj.soldOut) return null;

HINT: first two piece of code has the same output
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A piece of code that i wont need but maybe take a look at in the pizza menu project so i keep it here:

 <Pizza
        name='Pizza Spinaci'
        ingredients='Tomato, mozarella, spinach, and ricotta cheese'
        photoName='pizzas/spinaci.jpg'
        price={10}
      />
      <Pizza
        name='Pizza Funghi'
        ingredients='Tomato, mushrooms'
        price={12}
        photoName='pizzas/funghi.jpg'
      />
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 when we want to use a condition in the classes of a element in react we can use template literals like this;

<main className={`pizza ${pizzaObj.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}></main>

TIP: this line of code will check the condition and if its true then returns the "sold-out" string and if not true then returns an empty string
